Alea iacata est

Alea iacat est ("The die is  cast") is a Latin phrase attributed by Suetomius
(as iacata  alea est) to Julius Caesar  on January 10, 49 BC
as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Nothern Italy. With this step,
he entered Italy at the head of this army in defiance of the Senate and began
his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The phrase has been
adopted in Italia (Il dado è tratto), Romanian (Zarurile au fost aruncate),
Spanish (La suerte está echaba), French (Les dés sont jetés), Portuguese (A
sorte està lançada) , Dutch (De teerling is geworpen),
German (Der Würfel ist gefallen), Hungarian (A kocka el van vetve) and many other languages to
indicate that events have passed a point of no return.
